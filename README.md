Coursework and projects

"Machine learning has been successfully applied to many different areas such as autonomous control of cars and robots, natural language processing, image recognition,
health science, biology, and data mining. This course introduces fundamental concepts and methods to learn from data for computational data analysis, including pattern
recognition, prediction, and visualization. For this, this course covers supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. This course mainly focuses on
understanding fundamental concepts, learning basic machine learning models, and implementing and applying them to various real-world problems."
